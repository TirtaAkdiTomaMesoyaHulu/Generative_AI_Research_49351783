    - Interview Data: All interview notes and data.
    - Paper Proposal: Where we put final proposals.
    - Raw Data: The original, unprocessed data we collected.
    - Reference Sources: A list of all the articles and papers we used.

    - Submit a Pull Request: When you're done, ask to merge your changes into the main project. Another person will check your work first.
